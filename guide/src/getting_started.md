# Getting Started

Some of the prerequisites for the the NGAO model are [CUDA] and [Rust].
[CUDA] is the programming language that [CEO] is written into, meaning that a machine with a recent NVIDIA GPU  is also mandatory.
[Rust] is the programming language for DOS Actors.

Once both are installed, we can start writing our first optical model.
